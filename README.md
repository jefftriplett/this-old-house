### EGO Lines

The EGO line has treated me well. From a lawn mower, blower, and a weed eater, I have not been disappointed with the line nor their power and battery time. 

My general advice is to check both the price of the product with and without batteries to maximize your savings. I have saved $100 on a weed eater and paid an extra $30 on a leaf blower to include the same battery effectively saving $70. For my size of lawn, I don't need that many batteries sitting around. 

## Hardware

- [Govee Thermometer Hygrometer, Accurate Indoor Temperature Humidity Sensor](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y36FWTT/) - These are cheap and great.
- [Gardena 36004 Garden Hose Quick Connector Starter Set](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SDY5/) - While I hate having to water my lawn, I also hate having mud in my house all late Fall through early Spring. These make connecting everything quick and easy. 
- [Radius Zone Mosquito Repeller from Thermacell](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KSK7DQM/) - Mosquito are a pain, but these do an effective job of keeping them away. They aren't cheap, but one lasted me for a whole year. 
- [Flexzilla Garden Hose, 5/8 in. x 100 ft.](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0080JA346/) - I bought this from a WC review and it's great. 
- [GARDENA ZoomMaxx Oscillating Sprinkler on Weighted Sled Base](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CRF2QD0/) - This works better than one of the better reviewed sprinkler that I purchased. As a bonus you can daisy chain another sprinkler off of it. 
- [Wardrobe Light, OxyLED Motion Sensor Closet Lights](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HO1FLDI/) - My house has a few closets that do not have lights in them. These work great for the price.
