### EGO Lines

The EGO line has treated me well. From a lawn mower, blower, and a weed eater, I have not been disappointed with the line nor their power and battery time. 

My general advice is to check both the price of the product with and without batteries to maximize your savings. I have saved $100 on a weed eater and paid an extra $30 on a leaf blower to include the same battery effectively saving $70. For my size of lawn, I don't need that many batteries sitting around.
